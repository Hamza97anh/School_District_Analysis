  3- Provide a chart that shows the top five schools via top_schools, and the bottom five schools via bottom_schools.
  4- Make two charts that show average math grades and average reading grades accross different grade levels for each school via math_scores_by_grade & reading_scores_by_grade.
  5- Include in the per_school_summary_df the effects of spending on students' overall performace. 
  6- Provide a data chart that shows the overall impact of spending for all schools on average via spending_summary_df.
  7- Include in the per_school_summary_df the effects of school size on students' overall performace.
  8- Provide a data chart that shows the overall impact of school size for all schools  via size_summary_df.
  9- A chart that compares the performace of Charter vs District schools via type_summary_df
